<h1> Needs header / navigation menu still</h1>

<p>I like to share some alpha for investing in Splinterlands every once in a while and since I’m starting out with a standard deck, I figured I’d give it a shot again. I’m going to update some strategies 
I’m still using as well as share some new strategies I’ve developed since my <a href="https://www.splintertalk.io/@gniksivart/top-5-strategies-to-invest-in-splinterlands-for-new-investors">last article.</a></p>
<!-- Update the link above to refer internally to my website and update the link on Medium as well -->

<p>I’m not sure if a bear market is near or not, but it’s probably worth starting your investment now rather than waiting for further discounts on what you’re looking to invest in. 
Always keep some crypto/stables sitting on the side, however; just in case that card/pack you’re itching to buy does drop in price.</p>

<p>Just a reminder I’ve never made money on a single trade and am a middle-of-the-road IQ investor, aka the worst kind. I do much better buying 100 lottery tickets every week than following my own advice.</p>

<h1>Neutral Reward Cards</h1>

<p>I just sold my last Lord Arianthus for close to 100x returns. I remember buying this card for around $1 per card and sweating when it started to drop below $1. 
I wish I would have bought more now selling them maxed out close to $1000 apiece.</p>

<p>I still think this is a valuable and unique card to own. For one it is a unique neutral legendary card that can be played with any deck and has no attack.</p>

<p>Even if this card's “power level” falls out of favor the fact it was the first or one of the first tank cards with no attack will mean it will always be a special card for collectors.</p>

<p>If this card ever falls back to around $100 maxed out or less than $10 a card I will probably start buying them again to put them on the rental market to wait for the price to go back up. 
Disclaimer: I would be very surprised if the prices do drop down this low, but more drastic price drops have been seen in crypto bear markets.</p>

<h1>Spirit Miner (Neutral Reward Card 2)</h1>

<p>Spirit Miner I very much used the same strategy as Lord Arianthus. He’s a reward legendary that’s neutral, was cheap and purchased for around $1 or less, and rented very well.</p>

<p>Once again this card got close to $1000 when maxed out and took advantage by selling a few maxed out cards for around $700 — $800 for some very nice returns as well as renting them out for a few months before then.</p>

<p>Spirit Miners I was able to max out several cards as well as keep some cards as a level 1 single card. I think the key to investing in cards is to either keep them as singles or max them out once you have enough cards.</p>

<h1>Flipping Single Cards</h1>

<p>I’ve always assumed that single cards would have the best and most liquid resale capabilities and I haven’t seen anything to verify this assumption is incorrect. Single cards seem to always sell for a premium, 
especially when compared to cards that aren’t maxed out.</p>

<center><img src="Grum Flameblade Prices.png" alt="Image of the Grum Flameblade which is a fire legendary card and the prices at the time the screenshot was taken"></center>

<p>I think this is true for the following reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, most players go to the market in search of specific cards to max out in the decks they are playing. They might get lucky and find someone who has already combined 3 cards 
(in this example assuming they’re 3 cards short from maxing the card), but 9 times out of 10 they’ll end up buying single cards to reach their match because that’s what they can afford at the time.</p>

<p>This leads to my second reason is that most players can only afford to purchase a single card or two at a time and can’t afford to purchase a fully maxed out card. The pool of players and investors 
looking to purchase single cards is much higher therefore they are more liquid and easier to sell when needed which makes them great investible cards.</p>

<h1>All Booster Packs (Focused on Chaos Legion)</h1>

<p>Now I don’t want to say I told you so, but . . . <a href="https://www.splintertalk.io/@gniksivart/9-steemmonster-cards-and-summoners-i-m-buying">I told you so</a>. 
Alpha packs maxed out at 990 Hive during the peak of the market and are currently selling for around $200 or 100x from when they initially went on sale.</p>

<center><img src="Beta Booster Pack.png" alt="Screenshot from the Splinterlands website showing a Beta Booster Pack from when the game was called Steem Monsters"></center>

<p>Beta packs maxed out at just below 200 Hive and are currently selling for around $70 per pack on <a href="https://tribaldex.com/trade/BETA">Tribaldex.</a> 
Orbs packs are selling for around $50, Untamed packs for $37, and Dice packs for $60.</p>

<p>If I was just starting out I would be stacking as many Chaos Legion packs as I could from a “3rd party” site like Tribaldex. Yes, you miss out on the chance of an airdrop, 
but right now the packs are selling for 25% off. Until I can get some free packs from my vouchers, I’m buying Chaos Legion packs off Tribaldex like a mad man.</p>

<center><img src="Chaos Legion.png" alt="Image of the Chaos Legion graphic for the Chaos Legion Booster Packs"></center>

<p>I’m sitting on 2 Alpha Packs, 3 Beta Packs, 21 Orb Packs, 200+ Untamed Packs, 1 Dice Pack, and 50+ Chaos Packs. Until Alpha hits $1000, Beta $500, Untamed $250, Chaos $50, Orb $800, 
and Dice $400 I will continue buying up packs as I can.</p>

<h1>Alpha Cards</h1>

</p>Alpha cards seem to always carry a premium in collectible card games. Just look at the Alpha Black Lotus in Magic the Gathering and the 1st edition Charizard in Pokemon. 
The prices of these cards fluctuate just like anything else depending on the market environment they are in, but they are always slowly increasing in value over the years as they become more and more sought after.</p>

<center><img src="2019 Maxed out Alpha Set.png" alt="Image of the Chaos Legion graphic for the Chaos Legion Booster Packs"></center>

<p>In my first <a href="https://www.splintertalk.io/@gniksivart/9-steemmonster-cards-and-summoners-i-m-buying">post</a>, I made some predictions on Alpha cards that I thought would do the best, 
but at this point, I don’t think you can go wrong by purchasing any of the cards.</p>

<center><img src="2022 Maxed Out Alpha Set.png" alt="Image of the Chaos Legion graphic for the Chaos Legion Booster Packs"></center>

<p>As you can see from @jrvacation’s post a few years ago, to the price analysis I just ran a few days ago, the value of a maxed-out Alpha set has increased by almost 20x. 
Not as good as the sealed Alpha packs, but incredible returns from an investment standpoint and not counting any returns from using the cards to win tournaments or to rent out to others as passive income.</p>

<h1>Splintershards (SPS)</h1>

<p>The governance token for Splinterlands is and will continue to be a great asset for me to hold on to. Right now the airdrop is creating a lot of sell pressure on the price, 
but once that stops I expect the price to perform very well as long as Splinterlands continues to be a success.</p>

<center><img src="What is SPS.png" alt="Screenshot from the Splinterlands website where they describe what Splinterhards is as well as some of the benefits"></center>

<p>Right now the more cards and packs that you hold the more SPS you’re airdropped on a daily basis. You can then stake that SPS to earn passive income every day. 
The amount of staked SPS that you have then allows you to get airdropped vouchers, which can be used to purchase “free” Chaos Legion packs, or sold for more SPS.</p>

<p>Right now SPS is a win, win, win, and win. I don’t see that changing anytime soon with the incredible way in which the Splinterlands team seems to understand how to create value for everything in their control.</p>

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>Splinterlands continues to be a great investment for those looking to get into the NFT and Play to Earn market. It is quickly growing and then creators of Splinterlands continue to produce and expand 
the game like no one else in the crypto market, even during the bear market.</p>
