<p>Chances are you’ve been using Hive for a while now and never knew or used some of the tools available to you.</p>

<p>There is also a pretty high chance that once I’m done writing this article I’ll have more than a few comments asking why I didn’t talk about this 
other incredibly useful dapp that I didn’t even know about.</p>

<p>Hive is an incredibly large and diverse blockchain with something new being developed and updated on an almost weekly basis, 
but here are the ones I know about or find the most useful.</p>

<h1>Dapp Tracking — HiveDapps</h1>

<p>If you’re looking for a new Dapp on Hive, <a href="https://hivedapps.com/">HiveDapps</a> is a great place to start looking for Dapps you’ve never heard 
of before to expand your knowledge on what all is available on Hive.</p>

<p>I’m sure this list isn’t an all-inclusive list, but if you’re new to the Hive Blockchain and looking for other projects to support or 
want to do see what else is available, this is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Developed by <a href"https://medium.com/@therealwolf42">therealwolf</a> the home page starts with a list of dapps by the most users in 
the past 24 hours to the least. Then you can select different categories such as games, exchanges, interfaces, and so on.</p>

<h1>Browser Wallet — Hive KeyChain</h1>

<p>KeyChain is to Hive what MetaMask is to the Ethereum network. Instead of having to remember your private keys to interact with different dapps you can use KeyChain to save your keys and use it to allow access to different Dapps with just a password.
